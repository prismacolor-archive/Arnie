The idea for this project is based on the PyMUPDF library which allows you to extract text from PDFs by drawing rectangles around the text
and then extracting the data from within. The idea was that we would have a user upload a PDF using our GUI and then they could indicate 
where the stop and the start of their text was. From there, we could extract the text and then return it to the user.
